### Can this get me banned?
 According to [miHoYo's response to Script, Plug-In, and Third-Party Software](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/5763), I would say no. 
- This scanner does not exploit the game. It just takes pictures of the game window.
- This scanner does not provide artificial in-game progress.
- This scanner does nothing to provide account selling/exchanging.
- Doesn't provide Top-up Primogem. 

Also this scanner has random duration of pauses which makes the scanner prevent false positive by scanning too fast.
My account has been used to test this script and has yet to be banned or warned of the use of scripts.
