# Inventory Kamera - A Genshin Data Scanner
Fan-made Genshin Impact tool that scans your Characters, Weapons, Artifacts, Materials, and Character Development items in your Inventory using the OCR technique.

This scanner exports in `.GOOD`, a JSON-based exporting format, which allows you to use it with compatible online Genshin Impact tools. These tools include artifact optimizing tools including [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/), [SEELIE.me](https://seelie.me/), and [Aspirine's Genshin Impact Calculator](https://genshin.aspirine.su/).

Inventory Kamera supports both International (GenshinImpact.exe) and Mainland China (YuanShen.exe) launchers. Please read the following instruction on how you need to set up the scanner.

### How to Configure Inventory Kamera
Before starting the scanner, you can (optionally) choose to edit these following configurations:

- Configure which category (Weapons, Artifacts, Characters, Items) wanted to be scanned.
- Configure minimum weapon and artifact rarity to be scanned.

- Set the file export destination in the File Directory

### How to Run Inventory Kamera
Starts the Inventory Kamera scans by **leaving the game screen with the Paimon Menu stays open** and click 'Scan' to start scanning.

**While scanning, do not use your mouse or keyboard**. We uses your keyboard and mouse to automate artifact scanning.

You can terminate the scanning process at any time by pressing `ENTER` button. However, the application will not output any scanned results.

## Updating for new game versions

Inventory Kamera uses lists of valid items and characters to assist with text recognition. These lists are kept local in the `inventorylists` folder. These lists must be updated with every new version of the game and can be updated both automatically or manually.

### **Updating Automatically:**
Can be done easily with the `Update Lookup Tables` under `options`. Checking the `Create New Lists` option will force all lists to be created from scratch.

### **Updating Manually:**
All lists, with the exception of characters, are kept in a simple key:value JSON-readable formats. 'value' is the name of an item in [PascalCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)#Examples_of_multiple-word_identifier_formats) and 'key' is whatever 'value' is only in all lowercase. `materialscomplete.json` is the combination of `devmaterials.json` and `materials.json` so updating either of those requires and update to `materialscomplete.json`  as well. The format for manually updating characters is slightly different. The key for a character is still the lowercase version of the character's name in PascalCase. The value is of the following format:

``` json
{
    "GOOD": "SangonomiyaKokomi",
    "ConstellationOrder": [
        "burst",
        "skill"
    ],
    "WeaponType": 4
}
```

The character's name is as it appears in the party menu on the right side of the in-world UI or the character's menu screen in the top left corner. The constellation order depends on which talent the third constellation upgrades for each character. The weapon type values are as follows:

0 = Sword, 1 = Claymore, 2 = Polearm, 3 = Bow, 4 = Catalyst

Consider using [a JSON text validator](https://jsonlint.com/) after following this manual method.

## Can Inventory Kamera get me banned?
According to miHoYo's [response to Script, Plug-In, and Third-Party Software](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/5763), we believe not.
- This scanner does not exploit the game. It only takes pictures of the game window and navigates menus.
- This scanner does not provide artificial in-game progress.
- This scanner does nothing to provide account selling/exchanging.
- Doesn't provide Top-up Primogems.

We have neither heard of any reports nor received warnings of the application's development. However, that does not mean it will stay that way forever. We are at the mercy of miHoYo.
