# Inventory Kamera - A Genshin Data Scanner

An OCR Scanner that scans your characters, weapons, artifacts, materials and character development Items in Genshin Impact. Creates a 'GOOD' json formatted code when scanning characters, weapons and artifacts and is used to import data into [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/) and any other projects that adopt the GOOD format such as discord bots. It also create a 'Seelie' json fomat when scanning materials and character development Items to be used with [Seelie](https://seelie.inmagi.com/). This might changed later in future updates.Currently it only supports ENGLISH words.

### Can this get me banned?
 According to [miHoYo's response](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/5763), I would say no. 
1. This scanner does not exploit the game. It just takes pictures of the game window.
2. This scanner does no provide artificial in-game progress.
3. This scanner does nothing to provide account selling/exchanging.
4. Doesn't provide top up in primo gems. 
Also this scanner has random length pauses which makes sure it doesn't scan too fast to prevent false positives.
My account has been used to test this script and has yet to be banned or warned of the use of scripts.
